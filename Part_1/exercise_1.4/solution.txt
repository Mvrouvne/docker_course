I first names the container ex4 before running it with the --name flag, and I accessed it using "docker exec -it ex4 sh" and did these commands to install curl, apt-get update, apt-get -y install curl. And then I executed the same container (docker exec -it ex4 sh -c 'while true; do echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website; done') which gave me the output that I inputed Helsinki.fi and got a response! Screenshot is with this file.
